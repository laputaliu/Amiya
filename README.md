# Amiya
The coupled GNN model for reconstructing spatial metabolomics from spatial transcriptomics. Project named as CHIMERA, nick name Amiya. Based on pyg.


> ### Notes for Xiantong
> - This project is based on Saturn.
> - Since we haven't packaged the CHIMERA, the file paths in these scripts should be changed according to your own working env.
> - If you have any problem building your working env, you can use my conda env under the following path `/fs/home/liuzhaoyang/biosoft/mambaforge/envs/MS`. But don't directly install any new packages in my env.
> - If you want to test the model, start from a small data size.
